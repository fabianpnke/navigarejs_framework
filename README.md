<h1 align="center">Navigare</h1>

Navigare lets you quickly build a modern single-page app using classic server-side routing and controllers. Right now, we support Vue3 and Laravel only but the library is designed to work with other front-end and back-end frameworks as well. Find the full documentation [here](https://navigarejs.github.io/framework/).

## Acknowledgment

Thanks a lot to the maintainers of [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com/) and [Ziggy](https://github.com/tighten/ziggy) for the work they have done. Both of the libraries serve as an huge inspiration for this library but unfortunately they did not fit all the use cases that I was looking for.
