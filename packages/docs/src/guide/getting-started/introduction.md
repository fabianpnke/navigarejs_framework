# Introduction

Navigare is an alternative to [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com/) which allows you to create a modern SPA with a traditional back-end. If you already know how Inertia works you will easily learn how to use Navigare as well. If not, simply build controllers and page views like you've always done!

In comparison to Inertia, Navigare comes with a lot of innovative features:

- Vite integration
- Complex layouts (including modals and transitions)
- Type-safe routes in front-end
- Preload components whens links are hovered
- Real-time validation
- Defer property loading

Right now, `Vue` and `Laravel` are the only supported frameworks but the modular architecture allows other frameworks as well.

## Acknowledgment

Thanks a lot to the maintainers of [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com/) and [Ziggy](https://github.com/tighten/ziggy) for the work they have done. Both of the libraries serve as an huge inspiration for this library and in fact a lot of their work found their space in this framework. For example, this documentation is almost a copy of Inertia's documentation but of course it is adapted to Navigare. Unfortunately, both of the libraries did not offer a solution to all the use cases that I was looking for and hence I decided to start this project.
